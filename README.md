A Comparative Analysis of Speech Patterns Used by Successful and Unsuccessful Debaters

In this project, I analyze transcripts of Oxford-style debates. I look for 
disparities in the speech patterns of winners and loser. The different speech 
analyses I conduct include sentiment analysis and n-grams analysis. By 
doing this, I find the speech patterns that winners employ in order to be more convincing
and ones that are correlated with the losing.

The academic paper describes the process and conclusion. All code used is also viewable.
