A Comparative Analysis of Speech Patterns Used by Successful and Unsuccessful Debaters

In this project, I analyze transcripts of Oxford-style debates. I look for 
disparities in the speech patterns of winners and loser. I conduct different speech 
analyses on this text including sentiment analysis and looking at n-grams to analyze 
the attributes that differentiate the speech of winners from that of losers. By 
doing this, I find speech patterns that winners employ in order to be more convincing.

The academic paper describes the process and conclusiong. All code used is also viewable.
